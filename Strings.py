#The first new thing I learned about strings is (b[x:y])
#append adds things to a string or list format is x.append("y")
#len(x.len) shows the amount of items/characters in a variable or other
#add x.add("y") adds y to the x set
#update x.update(y) adds mulitple things to x. Y is a variable and it adds everything in the y set to the x set
#strip x.strip(y) strips the x string of y so that if y is "a" and x is Bad it would just be bd
#upper x.upper() puts the x string into upper case letters
#lower x.lower() puts the x string into lower case letters
#replace x.replace("y","z") replaces all instances of y with z
#int int makes it makes it so that python realizes its an interger
#float float makes it so that python realizes its a decimal
#split x.split("y") split splits the orginally 1 single string into 2 seperate strings when it comes across y
#Tuple: its like a list but it cant be changed like a list can, its to create one you just use ()
#max(X) gives the maximum element of a tuple, only used on tuples?
#min(X) gies the minumum element of a tuple, only used on tuples?
#(x.count("y")) counts the amount of y there is in a tuple, only in tuple?
#x.index("y") gives the syntax for the first occurance of y in a tuple
#x.find("y") looks to find where "y" is and gives the location of it
#'()','()'.format(x,y) it puts x and y into the brackets according to the order
#f' also does the same thing as format can put code into the brackets doe
#dir gives all the avaliable things you can do with the given string/function
#.insert inserts a varible into a list, it becomes a list within a list
#.extend adds a varible to the orginal list
#append adds a variable to the end of a list
#readline reads the Nth line of X
#readlines reads the Nth lines of X
#.remove removes X from the Y list,variable,tuple etc
#pop removes the last item from a list,variable,tuple. It returns the value it removes
#.reverse reverseds the items in a list,tuple etc.
#.sort sorts the items in a list, tuple etc. sort(reverse=True) puts it in descending order
#sorted it sorts a tuple,list etc but doesnt change the orignial list,tuple
#for index,Y in enumerate(X) print(index,Y), it gives the position in the list of the items in X
#.join joins a list with a string
#lists are changable. []
#tuples are not changable. ()
#sets are in a random order every time you call it. {}
#X.intersection(Y) compares the tow sets and tells what is in common.Only on set
#difference is like intersection but it does the opposite
#union joins sets togather
#dict(dictonaries) are basically folders in code. Also uses {} like sets do but looks different. {'name':'Cornelius', 'height':25, 'bodies':0, 'classes':['math','scinece','engineering','latin']
#X.update updates the dict. You have to put what you want to change after in parenthesis
